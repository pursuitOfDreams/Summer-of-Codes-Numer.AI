# Note
The submission contains a .ipynb and a .py file. You can see the approach of solving throught markdowns in .ipynb and it also contains the output on running mainRun for 100000 iters using Q3.npy as model.
Please find that the trained models are kept in files Q,Q1,Q2,Q3.npy. Please uncomment the line to load the Q matrix before running the mainRun function. Also Q3.npy works best among all the models.
